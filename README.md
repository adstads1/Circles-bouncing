# Circles-bouncing program
A simple satisfying JavaScript program that developed my JavaScript knowledge.
The program has 20 circles that move around of a screen of a dimension of 1900px by 950px, or designed for an aspect ratio of 16:9.
The balls have different colors, move around independently and have been positioned at different areas of the canvas randomly.

This project solified my knowledge of:
* The JavaScript syntax
* Immediately Invoked Function Expression (which I researched due to my project but not implemented in my program)
* Classes, functions, properties, object literals, constructors
* Basic principles of WebGL
* For loops and if statements.

Feel free to use and implement the program.
